## The program's configuration
{: .left}
The configuration information are specified in the same `run` or `run.bat` file used earlier.

The `java -jar futbin-watcher-x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar` part is followed by:

* Mandatory arguments:
  * `--platform=PLATFORM_NAME`: where *PLATFORM_NAME* is either `pc`, `ps` or `xbox`.
  * `--players-list=FILE`: where *FILE* is the file describing the monitored players.
* Optional arguments:
  * `--refresh-delay DELAY`: where `DELAY` is the amount of minutes between each call to FUTBIN. Can't be lower than 2, which is the default value.
  * `--lowest-bin-2`: if specified, adds a 2nd lowest BIN column to the tables.
  * `--lowest-bin-3`: if specified, adds a 3rd lowest BIN column to the tables.

#### Examples
{: .left}
* `java -jar futbin-watcher-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar --platform=pc --players-list=players_list.txt --refresh-delay=5`
* `java -jar futbin-watcher-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar --platform=xbox --players-list=players_list.txt --lowest-bin-2 --lowest-bin-3`

## The monitored players' list configuration
{: .left}

The monitored players can be described in any file you want, as long as you specify its name to the program with the `--players-list` argument.  
For convenience, a `players_list.txt` file with sample players is provided.

Here's the file format (all in the same line):

* The action you want to do (`buy` or `sell`)
* Space(s)
* The FUTBIN or FUTPC URL of the player
* Space(s)
* Your target price

**Note:**  
You can ignore a line by prefixing it with `#`.  
For example:


#### Examples:

    buy  http://www.futpc.com/player/3095/marco-reus        for 80000
    buy  http://www.futpc.com/player/3199/ramires buy       for 20000
    sell http://www.futpc.com/player/3197/filipe-lu%C3%ADs  for 5000
    sell http://www.futpc.com/player/3093/mesut-%C3%B6zil   for 4000
    # buy http://a-player-i-don-t-wanna-track-at-the-moment   for 900000

**Note:**  
If you want to have more tables with different players for each one, just make multiple run files, specifying a different players' list in each one.
